# Insurance-Related-Home-Accident-Forecasting

This repository presents a predictive model designed to assess the likelihood of building accidents occurring within an insurance period.

## What I did:
This section provides detailed explanations of the process I did.

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
##### Unveiled underlying patterns:
Conducted a thorough EDA to identify significant relationships between features and the target variable.
##### Enhanced data quality:
Implemented data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Machine Learning Implementation:
##### Model experimentation:
Evaluated a diverse range of classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
##### Hyperparameter optimization:
Employed Grid Search and cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.

### Class Imbalance Handling:
##### Addressing data bias:
Implemented an oversampling technique to mitigate the effects of class imbalance and ensure fair model evaluation.
##### Iterative refinement:
Retrained and reevaluated models after oversampling to assess the impact on performance.

### Model Evaluation:
##### Comprehensive performance assessment:
Utilized relevant evaluation metrics (F1-score, weighted average) to gain a holistic understanding of model accuracy and precision.
##### Visualizing model capabilities:
Generated ROC curves and AUC scores to visually analyze the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances.
